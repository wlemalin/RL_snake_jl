"""
Move snake and update the game state.

This function performs a single step in the Snake game, updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, 
and determining whether an apple is eaten. It also updates the world grid to reflect the changes.

Args:
    world (Array): A 2D array representing the game grid where the snake moves. 
                   It contains values that denote empty cells, snake body, walls, apples, etc.
    head_pos (Array): A two-element array [row, col] representing the current position of the snake's head.
    body_positions (Vector{Array}): A vector of arrays where each array represents the positions 
                                    of the snake's body segments. The head is not included here.
    apple_pos (Tuple{Int, Int}): The current position of the apple in the game grid as a tuple (row, col).
    action (Symbol): The action taken by the snake, which determines the direction the snake will move.
                     It is typically a symbol representing one of the four possible directions (e.g., :up, :down).

Returns:
    Tuple:
        - game_over (Bool): A boolean indicating whether the game is over (true) or not (false). 
                            The game is over if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
        - score (Int): The current score after the move. The score increases by 1 if the snake eats an apple.
                       If the game ends due to collision, the score is returned as -1.
        - new_apple_pos (Tuple{Int, Int}): The updated position of the apple. If the snake eats the apple, 
                                           a new apple position is generated using `place_apple!`. 
                                           If no apple is eaten, it returns the current position.

The function proceeds as follows:
1. The snake's head is moved in the direction specified by the `action`.
2. It checks if the new head position causes a collision with the wall or its own body, in which case the game ends.
3. If the snake eats the apple, its score increases, and a new apple is placed in the world.
4. The world grid is updated to reflect the snake's new position and whether the tail should be shortened or not.

# Choose action using epsilon-greedy policy
"""
Choose an action using an epsilon-greedy policy.

This function decides the next action based on the epsilon-greedy policy: 
with probability `EPSILON`, it selects a random action (exploration),
